## **NASTASSIA BARKOVA**
_Future front-end developer_

### **About me**
About myself, I can say with confidence that I am characterized by constancy and perseverance.

I have no experience in IT, but while working at the bank, I learned to work from scratch in four completely different areas of activity. In this I was helped by my ability to quickly assimilate new information, analytical mindset and purposefulness.

I learned to work in a team, with a large amount of information in the multitasking mode and to approach the set goals responsibly. I tend to be attentive to details and rational thinking.

Today I realize that the growth opportunities and perspectives in my profession don't match my goals. So I decided to try my hand at front-end development. I want to get new knowledge, to show my creativity in new projects and to satisfy the visual inside of me.
